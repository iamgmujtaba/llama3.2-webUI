# User friendly Llama3.2 Multimodal Web UI using Ollama

**CodeLlama Multimodal Web UI** is a user-friendly interface for interacting with the **Ollama** platform’s **Llama 3.2 multimodal model**, which supports both **text** and **image** inputs. This versatile interface allows users to ask questions, submit prompts, and receive responses in the form of text, code, and even visual outputs, harnessing the power of **multimodal AI**.

This code is tested on Ubuntu.


## Features

- **Multimodal Input Support**: Submit both text and image inputs to receive context-aware responses.
- **Formatted Responses**: Highlighted code blocks and detailed explanations for code outputs.
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Easily copy code snippets directly from the UI for seamless integration into your projects.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Output**: View text, images, and other media types generated by Llama 3.2.

## Installation

To run CodeLlama Multimodal Web UI locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ``
    git clone https://github.com/iamgmujtaba/llama3.2-webUI
    ``

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ``
    cd llama3.2-webUI
    ``

3. **Ensure Ollama are installed** on your machine:
    - Install Ollama [here](https://ollama.com)

4. **Run the application** using the included shell script:

    ``

    ``

   This will start the local development server and automatically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

### 1. Interacting with the UI

Once the interface loads in your browser, you can:

- **Submit Text Inputs**: Type your question or prompt in the input box and hit **Submit**.
- **Upload Images** (Coming soon): You will soon be able to upload images to receive both text and visual-based responses from the model.

### 2. Viewing Responses
- **Formatted Text**: Responses are displayed in a clean, readable format.
- **Highlighted Code**: Any code snippets returned are syntax-highlighted for better readability.
- **Multimodal Responses**: When image inputs are supported, you will also receive generated images, annotations, or detailed explanations of the content.
